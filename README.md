# Branch-Predictor-Simulator
Designed a trace-driven simulator to model bimodal, gshare and hybrid branch predictors using Smith Counters. 
Implemented a branch target buffer (BTB) to cache previous predictions. 
Implemented a hybrid branch prediction algorithm that dynamically chooses between the outcome of the bimodal and gshare predictors. Studied the effects of varying global branch history bits and PC bits on the misprediction rates for various trace benchmarks.
